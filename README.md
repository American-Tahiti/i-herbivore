##Policy for Open Source Contribution
I welcome and appreciate contributions in fixing bugs and enhancing features. Please submit pull requests (PRs) that DO NOT modify the site's existing design unless first discussed with me, the author. Please also only submit PRs that are related to bug fixes or feature enhancements. Editing text in the README file is discouraged, and PRs with unnecessary editing (e.g., adding unrelated text, changing the design of the web page, modifying the README text arbitrarily) will highly likely be marked as "spam" and "invalid."
If you are interested in contributing to the new features directly, please explain your design decisions and how your design matches this project's style in the PR. If you fix bugs, please explain which bug you fixed and how you fixed it. The explanations that you put in each PR can greatly help me determine if the changes can be merged into the main branch. PRs with no explanations will highly likely be rejected and marked as "wontfix." Thank you for your attention and interest!
